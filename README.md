# Property Finder With Advanced Filters
A simple web page that lets you find properties based on various preferences, including but not limited to city, type of property, price range and much more. It also supports advanced serach mode that lets you search using in depth filters that best suits your preferences.
### Usability
There are two main ways to use this application one is to use basic search in which you can use the given fields to narrow down your search. and underneath that the properties that are available will appear once clicked on search button.

Second way to use advanced filter in which you can further narrow down the search by using various filters. Quantity of the properties will be shown inside the popup, and once clicked on show properties all of the filtered properties will be shown.

Every thing is in src folder app folder contains all of the pages and the folders realated to next js. actions contains the logical server actions, components contains the reusable components, scenes contains the chunks of front end.</p>
<p>Constants.ts file contains the all of the constants of the project including images and filters</p>

### For the person evaluating the test.
<p>Despite the limited time available, I have made every effort to align the project with the specified requirements, both in terms of appearance and functionality. There are still a few minor bugs and quirks that need to be addressed. Additionally, the code quality could be improved with further refactoring, and some logic could be broken down into more reusable components and actions. I wanted to highlight that I'm aware of these issues and have done my best to tackle as much as possible within the time constraints. Thank you for your understanding!</p>
